HalfMoon RSS Reader
===================

This is a simple RSS reader for Windows.

It is basically abandonware.  Still, if you think you can get some use
out of it, go for it.

Requirements
------------

You will need [version 4.5 of the .Net framework](http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=30653).

You will need (at least) Visual Studio Express 2012 (with C# support) to build it.

Feedback
--------

Please send bug reports and feature requests to rjk@greenend.org.uk.
